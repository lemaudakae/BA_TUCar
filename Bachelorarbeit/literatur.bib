  abstract = {Davide Scaramuzza is Professor of Robotics at the University of Zurich. He is the founder and director of the Robotics and Perception Group. His main research interest is low-latency computer vision applied to the autonomous navigation of visually-guided ground and flying robots. Before, he was postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and ETH Zurich. He received his PhD in 2008 from ETH Zurich. He is the recipient of an ERC Starting Grant (2014), the IEEE Robotics and Automation Early Career Award (2014), a Google Reseaech Award (2014), the European Young Reseracher Award (2012), and the Robotdalen Scientific Award (2009). He is also coauthor of the book Autonomous Mobile Robots edited by MIT Press and author of the Omnidirectional Camera Calibration Toolbox for Matlab .},
